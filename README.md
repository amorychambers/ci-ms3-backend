## Project Goals 

This is a community-focused online library where users can create their own customised bookshelf with full database CRUD functionality; a user can decide to make their content private, but there is a community tab for sharing books and thoughts with other readers that may encourage them to buy and read something new.

### User Goals 

- A simple, clear, visually appealing way to catalogue and store their library online
- A space to preserve their thoughts about a book and to read others' thoughts
- Full control over their own content and data that has been stored in the database, in terms of privacy and in editability 

### Site Goals

- A clear and easy-to-navigate layout for all information
- An accessible and responsive site that ensures an equally good experience regardless of how the user wants to interact with the site
- Efficient, useful data management and access, providing a valuable resource for users
- Option to monetise the site by use of referral links to buy books from user recommendations

### Developer Goals

- Create a site that allows users to easily and intuitively interact with a database
- Design the site to make valuable and enjoyable use of the data collected from users
- The site is accessible to a wide range of users, with a clear and easy-to-navigate structure for all information
- Customise the experience to appeal to the target demographic and to foster a sense of community

## User Experience

### Target Audience

- Readers and book enthusiasts
- Bloggers and reviewers
- Authors who may be interested in having their books reviewed on the site

### User Stories

## Design 

### Design Choices

I have opted for as simple and uncluttered a design as possible, drawing the attention more solely to the books on display. I have used a translucent overlay for all site content, on top of a background image that conveys the theme and tone of the site's design. By keeping the content within a relaxed, flat colour background, I intended to make both the content and the way that users can interact with the content clearer and more intuitive.

### Colours

I used [HTML Color Codes](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-picker/) to choose two analogous complementary colours for both the primary background and accent colours.

### Fonts

I used two fonts on the website; one of which I used for the main brand image and link present in the header of every page, which is a display font conveying tone, and one clearer font for any body of text in the site, which is easier and clearer to read.

[Whisper](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Whisper) - Display font

[Cactus Classical Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Cactus+Classical+Serif) - Main text font
