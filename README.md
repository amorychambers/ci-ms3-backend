## Project Goals 

This is a community-focused online bookshelf where users can create their own customised bookshelf of the books they own with full database CRUD functionality; a user can decide to make their content private, but there is a community tab for sharing books and thoughts with other readers that might encourage them to buy and read something new.

### User Goals 

- A simple, clear, visually appealing way to catalogue and store their library online
- A space to preserve their thoughts about a book and to read others' thoughts
- Full control over their own content and data that has been stored in the database, in terms of privacy and in editability 

### Site Goals

- A clear and easy-to-navigate layout for all information
- An accessible and responsive site that ensures an equally good experience regardless of how the user wants to interact with the site
- Efficient, useful data management and access, providing a valuable resource for users
- Option to monetise the site by use of referral links to buy books from user recommendations

### Developer Goals

- Create a site that allows users to easily and intuitively interact with a database
- Design the site to make valuable and enjoyable use of the data collected from users
- The site is accessible to a wide range of users, with a clear and easy-to-navigate structure for all information
- Customise the experience to appeal to the target demographic and to foster a sense of community
